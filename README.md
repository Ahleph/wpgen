This project takes as input a png image (new.png in the src directory) and returns a new image in the src directory, new2.png.

The resulting image has *442 symmetry (as classified in Conway's "The Symmetries of Things")

With python 2.x and PIL 1.1.7 installed, run python s442.py to transform the image new.png into the image with symmetries new2.png.
