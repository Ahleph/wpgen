This project takes as input a png image (new.png in the src directory) and returns a new image in the src directory, new2.png.

The resulting image has *442 symmetry (as classified in Conway's "The Symmetries of Things")

With python 2.x, run python s442.py to transform the image new.png into the image with symmetries new2.png.
